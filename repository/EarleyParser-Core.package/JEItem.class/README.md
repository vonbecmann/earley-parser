an Earley item or state 

 [ rule, dotIndex, chart ].

- an item with the dot at the beginning (just after the arrow) is known as a predicted item, since it results from a prediction.
- an item with the dot at the end is called a final (reduce) item, since the dot at the end means that the whole right-hand side 	has been recognized and can be reduced.
