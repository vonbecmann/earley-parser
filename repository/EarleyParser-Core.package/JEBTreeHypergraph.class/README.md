Backward Directed Tree Hypergraph.
A directed hypergraph H' is a pair (N, H) where N is a set of nodes and H is a set of directed hyperedges.

shared packed parse forest (SPPF).

A B-graph (or B-hypergraph) is a hypergraph whose hyperarcs are B-arcs.
I'm a B-graph. (Backward Directed Hypergraph)

all nodes are reached from the root node.
