an ordered pair of objects.

(first . second)

first - an object.
second - an object.

In mathematics, an ordered pair (a, b) is a pair of mathematical objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair (a, b) is different from the ordered pair (b, a) unless a = b.
Let ( a1 , b1 )  and ( a2 , b2 )  be ordered pairs. Then the characteristic (or defining) property of the ordered pair is:

    ( a1 , b1 ) = ( a2 , b2 ) if and only if a1 = a2  and  b1 = b2 .
