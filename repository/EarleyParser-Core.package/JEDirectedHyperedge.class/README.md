While graph edges are pairs of nodes, hyperedges are arbitrary sets of nodes, and can therefore contain an arbitrary number of nodes.

Each directed hyperedge is an ordered pair (S, t)  from an arbitrary nonempty set S (source nodes) to a single node t (target node)
Source nodes could be empty when there is a empty or epsilon rule.

A directed hyperedge or hyperarc is an ordered pair, E = (X, Y); X is the tail of E while Y is its head. The tail and the head of hyperarc E will be denoted by T(E) and H(E), respectively.

A backward hyperarc, or simply B-arc, is a hyperarc E = (T(E), H(E)) with |H(E)| = 1

I'm a backward hyperarc.
