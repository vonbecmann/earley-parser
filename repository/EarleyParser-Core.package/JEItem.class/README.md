chart: where the recognition of the dotted rule started.

- an item with the dot at the beginning (just after the arrow) is known as a predicted item, since it results from a prediction.
- an item with the dot at the end is called a final (reduce) item, since the dot at the end means that the whole right-hand side has been recognized and can be reduced.
- an item with the dot in front of a non-terminal is call it a prediction item, since it gives rise to predictions.
