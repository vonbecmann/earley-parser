In mathematics, a hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which an edge can connect any number of vertices(nodes).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph.

A B-graph (or B-hypergraph) is a hypergraph whose hyperarcs are B-arcs.

Backward Directed Tree Hypergraph.
A directed hypergraph H' is a pair (N, H) where N is a set of nodes and H is a set of directed hyperedges.

shared packed parse forest (SPPF).

A B-graph (or B-hypergraph) is a hypergraph whose hyperarcs are B-arcs.
I'm a B-graph. (Backward Directed Hypergraph)

all nodes are reached from the root node.
nodes - is an array of unique hypernodes.
edges - is an array of unique directed hyperedges.
